# Sample iOS App using MVVM Design Pattern and Test Driven Development

This is a tutorial/demo app that has a sole purpose of promoting best coding practice using MVVM design pattern in Swift. 

### Development Approach
An iterative development process using Test Driven Development (TDD) has been used to develop this app, which ensures that maximum test cases are written for different components - view models, services, etc. - during the app development phase. Moreover, using Dependency Injection made this code loosely coupled, thereby, enhancing the testability of the app.

- Please contribute if there is a room for further improvement.

### Functionality

This is a simple app that requests a web API, and display the response to the user in the form of a table view.
