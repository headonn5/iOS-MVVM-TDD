# Sample iOS App using MVVM Design Pattern and Test Driven Development

This is a tutorial/demo app that has a sole purpose of promoting best coding practice using MVVM design pattern in Swift. An iterative development approach using Test Driven Development (TDD) has been used to develop this app, which ensures that 100% of test cases are written for the custom classes when an app is developed. Moreover, maximum employability of dependency injection has been ensured keeping clean architecture in mind.

- Please contribute if there is a room for further improvement.
